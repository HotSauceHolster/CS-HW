My work is in helpers.c, it is a set of functions to apply one of 4 filters to a bmp image. grayscale, reversed, blur or edge detection. command line args for running the program:
./filter -g,r,b or e <.bmp input file location> <output file name.bmp>
The <> are for visibility here, not actually used when running it.
The rest of the code was provided by the assignment.
